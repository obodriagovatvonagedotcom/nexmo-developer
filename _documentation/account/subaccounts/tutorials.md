## Account balance and credit
All Nexmo accounts have an associated account balance. It shows the amount of funds available for spending. The account balance is deducted each time a chargeable API call is made. When account balance reaches zero, chargeable API calls cannot be executed unless the account has a credit line provided by Nexmo. If an account has a credit, then its account balance can go below zero. A postpaid account is an account that has credit, a prepaid account is an account without credit.

The amount of credit available to the customer is called a credit_limit. Thus, any postpaid account that has a positive balance has |account_balance| + |credit_limit| funds available for spending. A prepaid account has only |account_balance| available for spending.

## Subaccount creation

By default, a newly created subaccount will share its balance with the primary account, i.e. any charges resulting from the subaccount's activity will be applied directly to the primary account's balance.
To create a subaccount with its own balance (all charges resulting from the subaccount's activity are applied directly to the subaccount's balance), one would need to set parameter "use_primary_account_balance" to FALSE. This change is irreversible. The subaccount with its own balance cannot be at a later stage converted back to the subaccount with a shared balance.


## Postpaid and prepaid subaccounts

Subaccounts with individual balance can be either prepaid or postpaid. Subaccounts that share balance with the primary account cannot be prepaid/postpaid because the shared balance belongs to the primary account.

Primary account type | Postpaid subaccounts | Prepaid subaccounts | Subaccounts with shared balance
-- | -- | -- | --
Postpaid primary account | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ 
Prepaid primary account | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ 

**Key:**
* ✅ = Supported.
* ❌ = Not supported. 

If a primary account is prepaid, then the created subaccounts will aslo be prepaid. If the primary account is postpaid, then the created subaccounts can either be postpaid or prepaid.

A subaccount (with individual balance) becomes postpaid only if the primary postpaid subaccount allocates some of its credit to the subaccount (the credit amount is zero for the prepaid subaccount). Therefore, prepaid primary accounts that do not have credit cannot have postpaid subaccounts.

Feature | Postpaid subaccount | Prepaid subaccount | Subaccount with shared balance
-- | -- | -- | --
Individual balance | ✅ | ✅ | n/a
Individual credit | ✅ | 0 | n/a

**Key:**
* ✅ = Supported.
* n/a = Not applicable. 


## Balance transfer

A newly created subaccount with a shared balance can perform API calls directly, assuming the corresponding primary account's balance or credit (provided by Nexmo) is non-zero. A newly created subaccount with individual balance initially has a zero balance and therefore cannot make API calls. One needs to transfer some amount from the primary account to the the subaccount.

RULE: Balance_available_for_transfer =  |account_balance| + |credit_limit|

It means that the primary account can transfer funds to the secondary account, and these funds can come either from its balance (assuming it is positive) or from the credit provided by Nexmo. It is also possible to transfer balance from the subaccount back to the primary account, but direct transfer of balance between subaccounts is not supported.

## Credit allocation

A primary account is considered postpaid if it has a credit provided by Nexmo. The postpaid primary account can allocate a part of its credit to one of its subaccounts. Thus, it is possible to have a subaccount with a zero balance but non-zero credit. This subaccount will be able to make API calls untill the allocated credit runs out. In general, any account that has a positive balance has |account_balance| + |credit_limit| funds available for spending.

RULE: Credit_available_for_allocation =  |credit_limit| - |account_balance|, if account_balance < 0 AND
                                         |credit_limit|, if account_balance > 0 

It means that the primary account can allocate credit that has not been already spent/allocated to the secondary account, and vice versa (credit that was not used by the subaccount can be returned to the primary account).

Example: A postpaid primary account with zero balance was given €100 in credit by Nexmo. Before spending any of its credit, the primary account allocated €20 euro of its credit to one of its subaccounts. The primary account's remaining credit became €80: |credit_limit| = 100 - 20 = 80. Then the primary account made API calls worth €15. Thus the primary account still had |80| - |-15| = €65 that it could allocate.

## Charges and monitoring of spending

Nexmo charges for the actual Nexmo API usage. The usage of each account is captured in the "balance" field returned by the Subaccounts API.

### Prepaid primary account
After top up, prepaid accounts receive a positive balance that gets deducted later with API usage. When zero balance is reached, the prepaid account cannot make any more API calls (until another top up). A prepaid primary account that distributed its balance across its subaccounts would not be able to make API calls, but its subaccounts with non-zero balance would still be able to make API calls. 
- The "total_balance" field returned by the Subaccounts API represents the amount of balance left across all subaccounts and the primary account from the initial top up made by the primary account.
- The "balance" field returned by the Subaccounts API shows the amount of balance left for each individual subaccount.

### Postpaid primary account
A postpaid primary account is responsible for spending of all of its subaccounts and its own spending (from the primary API key). The value that captures the total amount owned to Nexmo is the negative "total_balance" (positive "total_balance" means that nothing is owned to Nexmo). At the end of the month, Nexmo invoices a postpaid primary account for the whole negative "total_balance" amount.


## Best practices
* A Nexmo Partner should posses and manage a Nexmo primary account and should create subaccounts for its end customers; 
* The Partner should not use its primary API key (account) to perform API calls. If the Partner wants to use Nexmo API itself, the Partner should create another subaccount;
* When an end customer is close to using out all of its credit limit the Partner should either allocate additional credit limit to the end customer or wait for the end customer to pay before increasing end customer’s balance, otherwise the end customers API calls will be temporarily blocked;
* The Partner should not transfer any balance to the end customer’s subaccount unless the end customer has paid the equivalent amount of money to the Partner;
* It is up to partners to choose the mode of payment for their end customers: postpaid end-customers with allocated credit limit or pre-paid end-customers with zero in credit limit but with pre-allocated balance.

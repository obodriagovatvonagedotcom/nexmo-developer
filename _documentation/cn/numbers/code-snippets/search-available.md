# Search Available Numbers

This page shows you how to programmatically search for numbers that are available for purchase.

> You can also search for available numbers online, using the [developer dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/buy-numbers) or from the command line, using the [Nexmo CLI](https://github.com/Nexmo/nexmo-cli#search-for-new-numbers).

# Release Notes

## Version 5.2.0 - May 30, 2019

### New

- Add the `call` instance in `application.calls` map in `createCall()` function (IP -IP call)

- Update caller parameter in call object in a PSTN - IP call from `unknown` to `channel.from.number` or `channel.from.uri` if exists

- Emit the new `leg:status:update` event each time a member leg status change

```javascript
/**
  * Conversation listening for leg:status:update events.
  *
  * @event Conversation#leg:status:update
  *
  * @property {Member} member - the member whose leg status changed
  * @property {Event} event - leg:status:update event
  * @param {string} event.cid - the conversation id
  * @param {string} event.body.leg_id - the conversation leg id
  * @param {string} event.body.type - the conversation leg type (phone or app)
  * @param {string} event.body.status - the conversation member leg status
  * @param {Array} event.body.statusHistory - array of previous leg statuses
*/
conversation.on("leg:status:update", (member, event) {
  console.log(member, event);
});
```

- Add the the `channel.legs` field in member events offered by CS

```text
conversation.on(<member_event>, (member, event) {
  console.log(event);
  // member_id: <member_id>,
  // conversation_id: <conversation_id>,
  // ...
  // channel: {
  //  to: {
  //    type: app
  //  },
  //  type: app,
  //  leg_ids: [<leg_id>]
  //  legs : [{ leg_id: <leg_id>, status: <leg_status>}],
  //  leg_settings: {},
  // },
  // state: <state>,
  // leg_ids: []
});
```

## Version 5.1.0 - May 29, 2019

### New

- Send DTMF event to a conversation

 ```text
  * Send DTMF in a conversation
  *
  * @param {string} digits - the DTMF digit(s) to send
  * @returns {Promise<Event>}
 ```

```javascript
 conversation.media.sendDTMF('digits')
```

- Emit new event `audio:dtmf`

```javascript
conversation.on("audio:dtmf",(from, event)=>{
  event.digit // the dtmf digit(s) received
  event.from //id of the user who sent the dtmf
  event.timestamp //timestamp of the event
  event.cid // conversation id the event was sent to
  event.body // additional context about the dtmf
});
```

- Set customized audio constraints for IP calls when enabling audio

```javascript
 conversation.media.enable({
    'audioConstraints': audioConstraints
 })
```

```text
  * Replaces the stream's audio tracks currently being used as the sender's sources with a new one with new audio constraints
  * @param {object} constraints - audio constraints
  * @returns {Promise<MediaStream>} - Returns the new stream with the updated audio constraints.
  * @example
  * conversation.media.updateAudioConstraints({'autoGainControl': true})
  **/
```

- Update audio constraints for existing audio tracks

```javascript
  conversation.media.updateAudioConstraints(audioConstraints)
 })
```

### Fixes

- Remove 'this' passed to cache worker event handler

---

## Version 5.0.2 - May 30, 2019

### New

- Delete the image files before sending the `image:delete` request
- Attach of audio stream can now be chosen if it will be automatically on or off through `media.enable()`

### Changes (internally)

- Combine the network GET, POST and DELETE requests in one generic function

---

## Version 5.0.1 - April 30, 2019

---

## Version 4.0.2 - April 17, 2019

member.on("media:connection:fail",(connection_details)=>{
  connection_details.rtc_id // my member's call id / leg id
  connection_details.remote_member_id // the id of the Member the stream belongs to
  connection_details.connection_event: // the connection fail event
  connection_details.type // the type of the connection (video or screenshare)
  connection_details.streamIndex // the streamIndex of the specific stream
});
```

```text
* @event Member#media:connection:fail
*
* @property {number} payload.rtc_id the rtc_id / leg_id
* @property {string} payload.remote_member_id the id of the Member the stream belongs to
* @property {event} payload.connection_event the connection fail event
 ```

## Version 4.0.1 - March 4, 2019

### New

- Select the sync level for the login process
  - `full`: trigger full sync to include conversations and events
  - `lite`: trigger partial sync, only conversation objects (empty of events)
  - `none`: don't sync anything

  if the Cache module is enabled the manual fetch of a conversation will store them in internal storage

  usage:

  ```javascript
  new ConverationClient({'sync':'full'});
  ```

### Fixes

- remove `screenshare` https restriction

### Breaking changes (internally)

---

## Version 4.0.0 - February 1, 2019

### Breaking Changes

- rename SDK `stitch` to `client`
- listening for `media:stream:*` now gives `streamIndex` instead of `index` for consistency with the internal rtcObjects

 *
 * @property {number} payload.streamIndex the index number of this stream
 * @property {number} [payload.rtc_id] the rtc_id / leg_id
 * @property {string} [payload.remote_member_id] the id of the Member the stream belongs to
 * @property {string} [payload.name] the stream's display name
 * @property {MediaStream} payload.stream the stream that is activated
 * @property {boolean} [payload.video_mute] if the video is hidden
 * @property {boolean} [payload.audio_mute] if the audio is muted
 ```

### New

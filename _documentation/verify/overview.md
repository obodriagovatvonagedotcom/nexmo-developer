# Verify API

The Verify API enables you to confirm that you can contact a user at a specific number.

* Protect against spam, by preventing spammers from creating multiple accounts
* Monitor suspicious activity, by forcing an account user to verify ownership of a number
* Reach your users at any time, by ensuring that you have their correct phone number

The general workflow is shown in the following sequence diagram:

```js_sequence_diagram
Participant Nexmo
Participant Your server
Participant User
User -> Your server: User supplies phone number
Your server -> Nexmo: Request to Verify this number
Nexmo --> Your server: Supply `request_id`
Note right of Nexmo: Nexmo sends PIN code to user (multiple attempts as needed)
Nexmo -> User: 
Nexmo --> User: 
User -> Your server: Enter PIN code
Your server -> Nexmo: Check PIN is valid for `request_id`
Nexmo --> Your server: OK
```

## Getting Started

The following sample shows you how to start the verification process by sending a verification code to a user. To learn how to validate the code the user supplies and perform other operations, see the [Code Snippets](/verify/overview#code-snippets).

```

## Features

Nexmo Verify API offers powerful default behavior for easy integration. By default we will handle the code generation and verification, and deliver the message via the fastest route available. You can also control the user experience by defining which [workflow](/verify/guides/workflows-and-events) should be used for each request; by default Nexmo will use SMS followed by TTS and another TTS in most cases.

> It is possible to supply your own PIN code in some circumstances, please contact your account manager.

Delivery of the PIN code to the user uses a combination of SMS messages and [TTS](/concepts/guides/glossary#tts-api) (Text to Speech) calls based on the user's locale. For example, the TTS for a `61*` phone number is sent in English with an Australian accent (`en-au`). You can specify the language, accent and gender in the Verify request.
